# Wallpapers-2.0 

I just found a bunch of wallpapers I like and I put them into a github so I can download them again.

A lot of the wallpapers listed are from [this repository](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/Wallpapers)

I also will be downloading more I like from this [website](https://www.wallpaperengine.space/collections)
